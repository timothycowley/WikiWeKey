1. In some cases does not convert  bold marks to italic when needed:
**text*
2. In some circumstances does not use correct * to close italics 
*text **text should have used second*
3. With automatic links the last ">" is not removed:
<http://www.google.com>
4. Don't know why the user would do this, but one can place nested link starts to get this behavior:
<http<http://www.google.com>
5. EmphasisMarks within automaticLink causes duplication of text
*text <http://*link>
6. Preview occasionally breaks such that text is not interpreted properly, saving or restarting preview tends to fix this.
7. Links not working for filepaths
8. Crashes if filepath given in a link is invalid
9. New bug that occured in recent refactoring ~~ will close a bold mark
10. New bug that occured in recent refactoring: Marks are not removed from codeblocks: there is probably a typo in recognition sequence
